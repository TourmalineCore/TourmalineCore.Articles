# How to estimate tasks and make peace with deadlines

Correct task estimation is a crucial aspect of a project's success.

Hello everyone! My name is Margarita, I am a UI/UX designer at Tourmaline Core. In this article, I decided to share my experience, my takeaways and successful practices, and figure out what needs to be taken into account when estimating the time it takes to complete a task.

The article will be useful for both aspiring designers and other specialists who face burning deadlines and problems in estimating.


## Tasks should be estimated by the performer

Imagine a designer was given a task and a couple of hours to complete it. However, when they started digging into it, it turned out that there was much more work than expected, and it could not be completed in the allotted time. Why did it happen? 

From the outside, a task can often seem much simpler than it actually is, especially if it is set by a person not familiar with the pitfalls and potential setbacks. This is why the estimate should be done by the designer who will work on the task and who has an idea of the process and how much time it may take, and not by a manager, developer or anyone else.

We should also bear in mind that everyone works at their own pace. The same task may take two specialists a different amount of time since their experience, work speed, and skills are also different. Therefore, even the most experienced colleague will not be able to estimate the effort more accurately than the performer.


## Decomposition of large tasks

The first project I worked on was a corporate website for an Australian company (yes, I started with foreigners right away). The task was estimated something like: "Wow, this is a large task, it will probably take about a month and a half." In fact, for me the task was incomprehensible and immense. As a result, I randomly named what seemed to be a fairly long time enough for its completion, but this estimate had nothing to do with reality. The site was very large and the design work took a little more than two months. The increase in deadlines affected the work of the entire team.

Decomposition of a large task into small subtasks will help to avoid such a situation. You can break the website into pages, pages into blocks, complex blocks into components,  ~~components into pixels~~ and estimate them separately. The better you decompose the task, the easier it will be to realistically estimate it.

## Completing a task on time

At the beginning of my design journey, I faced the difficulty of estimating new tasks that I had had no experience with. I could not roughly estimate how much time it would take to complete them. At that time, I found a little trick that helped me cope with this problem. 

Let's imagine that a designer needs to estimate the time required to create a form for a website, but they have no experience working with forms. The trick is to note the time and make a small part, for example, to design one button. This will add clarity on the effort spent on this small part of the work. And the entire form consists of such parts.

Sometimes the task can be much more complex than the example above, and there is no time to try to implement it. In this case, it is useful to imagine the sequence of steps necessary to complete the task, think about potential unforeseen problems that can arise, and do additional research. It is also useful to draw an analogy with similar tasks and remember how much effort they usually took.

## Ideal conditions

A frequent mistake I made when estimating tasks was estimating work under ideal conditions. Let's take, for example, the task of creating an internal page of a website. The designer had already taken into account all the previous steps, broken the task into subtasks, estimated how long the design would take, and allocated a whole day for this activity. However, when they took to work, they faced the lack of ideas, needed to conduct research to look for good solutions, and draw various options. The day passed, and the designer had only made sketches of one section.

So what went wrong? When estimating, the designer thought about how long the design of certain components would take. They did not foresee reaching a dead end and lack of ideas. Sometimes it takes more time to think about a solution, try different options, throw out poor ones and keep a good one, look for inspiration, respond to colleagues' messages, join a call, eat a sandwich, after all. There are almost never ideal, sterile conditions for a task, so it makes sense to factor in some extra time it may take to find a solution in your estimate.


## Time for review

When working in a team, a designer often undergoes peer review. A mentor who checks the quality of work and makes edits, a developer who checks the design for feasibility. At this point, it is important to plan and evaluate not only your time, but also the time of your colleagues. They also have their own deadlines, timeframes, estimates, and priorities. And that lunch of theirs!

Let's imagine that the deadline for a design is on Tuesday evening. The designer completes the task on Tuesday at 4:00 PM and is happy to have managed to do everything on time. It's time for a review, but the colleague has a higher-priority task, and will only find time to look at the design on Wednesday afternoon. On Wednesday, the colleague did a review and it turned out that edits needed to be made. It would seem that the work was completed on Tuesday evening, but it can only be submitted on Thursday.

Don't forget to include some time buffer in the estimates to get a review without distracting your colleague from their tasks and make your edits without any rush.


## Time for edits

This is probably one of the most critical points when evaluating design creation. This point is directly related to ideal conditions. It is quite rare for a client to accept a design right away without any edits. To rework the font, correct the text, change the brightness all require extra time, which is important to take into account. This extra time for edits will allow you to make changes and meet the client’s deadlines. If the work happens to be accepted right away, tasks completed before the deadline will be a pleasant bonus for the client.

## Overtime

The most painful point, which I struggled with the longest. When you get the feeling that you can’t complete a task on time, you want to stay at work longer to work more and finish what you had planned. At first, it seems that overtime will help you complete the task as planned. In fact, everything works quite the opposite. The more you overwork, the more fatigue accumulates, the more you hate the task, and finally there is no energy and motivation left. The work slows down, you make mistakes, manage to do less and less while there is more and more overtime. It turns out to be a vicious circle: the more you overtime - the more you get tired - the worse you work - the less you accomplish -  ~~the more you cry at night~~. 

A designer who has learned to maintain the balance between work and rest is charged and energetic. This helps them to deliver high-quality work and meet deadlines.

## Overbaking the task

It happens that a task has already been completed, but the inner perfectionist finds new little things to latch onto. The designer can’t stop polishing their work, as a result, "overbakes" the task. The eye becomes blurry, and the same edits are made in a circle. Such a protracted work process can unreasonably increase the time of task completion, and the designer risks making things worse.

If the design already meets all the client’s expectations, this is a sure sign that it’s time to stop and move it on to development. In our practice, if the team understands that someone is keeping the task for too long, we try to bring the work to the point and submit it for approval, even if we want to make additional edits.

## Spreading yourself too thin 

Often beginning designers want to pack their designs with all the cool ideas and trends at once. However, it can steal the focus and disrupt the project deadlines. Not to let this happen, it is worth showing the client several possible directions upfront. This way you will cut off unnecessary options at the initial stage, focus on one solution and work on it, and put off the rest of the ideas for future projects. Or just throw them away.


## Real estimates

When estimating a project, we often feel uneasy to reveal the real effort it requires, anxious to get a negative reaction from the client or our colleagues. The shy designer lowers the estimate to the "standard" level because of the concern to be considered a poor specialist. As a result, the designer does not deliver the work on time and disappoints the client.

To avoid such a situation, it is extremely important to honestly estimate the effort and name the real numbers, even if it makes you uncomfortable. To make this conversation less painful, you need to explain in detail to the client the stages of work and why it takes so much time. If you cannot immediately provide an estimate, just tell them honestly and ask for extra time to figure things out, as I already mentioned in the previous sections of this article.


## Understanding the task

One of the most unpleasant moments in my career was designing a presentation for a German company. As I was inexperienced at the time, I didn’t make the adequate effort to gather requirements. Since the client had very little time for communication, he sent me a completed brief prepared by another designer. I did not insist on a more detailed analysis of the task and focused on the brief he’d sent me. During the demo, the client asked for a huge number of edits. As it turned out, I simply did not hit the style he needed, and the information in the brief was outdated and irrelevant.

This case demonstrated to me how important it is to thoroughly understand the task at hand and make sure that the designer's vision coincides with the client's vision. This will help to avoid constant rework and edits, which only increase the amount of work.


## Time for communication

Сommunication is a whole separate expense item on the list of task estimation. In our case, we blissfully didn’t bump our heads on it, but on the contrary, made it a successful practice when estimating the design of our company's corporate website. We added 30% of the total time required to complete the project for communication, including internal calls with the team, coordinating the design with the client and working with the feedback. This additional time turned out really helpful to complete the work on time.


## Conclusion

Estimating effort is an integral part of the development process that plays a key role in the success of a project. As a designer, I have faced many difficulties and made many mistakes when estimating tasks. However, thanks to the experience and practice I have gained, I have learned to apply effective strategies that help me meet deadlines and achieve better results.

The tips I gave in this article will help you look at the task from different angles, estimate them more accurately, and avoid many mistakes. Follow them, and you will relieve yourself of a significant share of anxiety and stress, create a comfortable workflow and meet the client’s expectations, which will lead to greater success of your project.
